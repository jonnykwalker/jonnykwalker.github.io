                                            <p>Over the last few years the healthcare industry has become targeted by threat actors more and more. 
                                                As a result, my cybersecurity teams in healthcare have had to constantly assess and adapt to new

                                            <p>The complexities of healthcare require equally complex solutions. A provider wearing multiple hats means 
                                                a single identity with multiple roles. A nurse that floats to other departments means concatenated access. 
                                                A physician credentialed in one area but learning a new specialty means completely different access 
                                                profiles depending on the department they log into. Unique situations require unique solutions and 
                                                constant adaptation.</p>

                                                members in the hospital. This includes being able to assist technical and non-technical staff and

                                            <p>Healthcare is a highly regulated industry, meaning that strict adherence to policy and framework 
                                                is required at all times. My roles required HIPAA and compliance being prioritized with any security,
